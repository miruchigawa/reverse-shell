A reverse shell is a type of shell in which the target machine initiates a connection back to the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to execute commands on the target machine remotely. This is typically achieved by the attacker setting up a listener on their machine and then tricking the target machine into executing a script or binary that establishes the connection back to the attacker's machine. Once the connection is established, the attacker can execute commands on the target machine as if they were sitting in front of it. Reverse shells are commonly used by attackers to maintain access to a compromised machine and to pivot to other machines on the network.
